h1. VIRGO

h2. Installation 

To install VIRGO, clone it, run bundler, then start it:

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:uvalib/virgo.git
bundle install
</pre>

You'll need to have mysql running somewhere and set up a database to use.  For the default database settings, please see config/database.yml in the stanza for "development" settings.  Feel free to change the development database settings if you like, but don't commit the changes.  Here's an example of setting up the database:

<pre>
mysql -u root -p
(enter your password)
create database blacklight_development;
grant all on blacklight_development.* to some_username@localhost identified by "some_password";
</pre>

Now that your database has been configured, you can run the migrations to load the tables and start your application:

<pre>
rake db:migrate
rails server
</pre>

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000

To run the tests, do the following from the command line:

<pre>
rake spec
</pre>

If you get path issues, try:

<pre>
bundle exec rake spec
</pre>

For the cucumber tests:

<pre>
rake cucumber (or bundle exec rake cucumber)
</pre>
